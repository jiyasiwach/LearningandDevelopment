Compared to branded modular kitchens, Magppie kitchens are commercially at par, but the materials are completely different. Compressed wood typically costs below Rs. 100 per sq. ft., while SilverStone costs around Rs. 500 per sq. ft. Magppie Wellness Kitchens are free from termites, bacteria, fungus, and mould, making them a healthier and more durable long-term solution.' },

Wardrobes start at Rs. 7,320 per sq. ft. This is based on the finish you choose. A 10x10 kitchen would typically cost between Rs. 12 to Rs. 15 lakhs.

Compressed wood contains toxins and is prone to termites, fungus, bacteria, and cockroaches. While wood costs under Rs. 100 per sq. ft., SilverStone costs about Rs. 500 per sq. ft.

  { id: 'faq-q51', sectionNumber: '5.F Q51', sectionTitle: 'Why choose SilverStone over granite?', category: 'faq', isVerbatimScript: false, content: 'SilverStone is an engineered upgrade over natural granite. Granite is porous — absorbs stains and bacteria. SilverStone is non-porous — hygienic and stain-proof. Granite varies in quality. SilverStone has uniform strength, finish, and performance. SilverStone is anti-bacterial and anti-viral, which granite is not. In short: granite is natural stone. SilverStone is next-generation stone.' },
